Description: # **Introduction: textfeatures**
        When we handle the text data, we always have concerns about the data features, pre-processing of data and more likely the predictions. To improve our model, it is important to understand the data and find the more interesting features in the data like hashtags, links and many more.
        
        ## **What is textfeatures?**
        
        It is a python package which helps you to extract the basic features from the text data such as hashtags, stopwords, numerics which will help you to understand the data and improve your model more effectively.
